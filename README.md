# automated_driving_simulation

This repository has codes I worked on during my Internship at KTH Royal Institute of Technology, Sweden. The aim of the project was to improve the test automation strategies for the platform built for verification of automated driving solutions.

## Software Involved
- MATLAB
- Simulink
- PreScan
- AutowareAI
- Python
- ROS (Robot Operating System)

## Final implementation
- Made multiple simulations possible.
- Enabled several runs for different world and vehicle scenarios.
- Removed the need for manual input once the script runs.
- Made script easily implementeable on any other setup.


## Contributing
I am the sole contributor to this project.
